//
//  AnselDenoiseClient.swift
//
//  Client for the `ansel-denoise-swift` executable (GPLv3). Part of PhotonsExtensions: it
//  spawns that program as a child process — nothing of it is linked, so this file stays MIT
//  and the extension module keeps its "no core dependency" rule (see README.md here).
//
//  Why a child process: the upstream network definition comes from `aurelienpierreeng/ansel-denoise`
//  (GPL-3.0). Compiling it into a separate executable and talking over a pipe keeps the two a mere
//  aggregate rather than a single work — the same arrangement already used for `hdrmerge-swift`
//  (also GPLv3). See Vendor/ansel-denoise-swift/README.md.
//
//  What this produces: a **denoised RGGB mosaic**, not an RGB image. The caller pairs it with
//  `DNGRawWriter` to get a legal lossless-compressed DNG whose black point and metadata are the
//  source file's own.

/// All variants share one weight set per camera (the CFA layout and noise level are inputs, not

///
/// | variant | params | 256² tile | σ reduction |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | `quarter` | 0.48 M | ~50 ms | 88 % |
/// | `half` | 1.90 M | ~216 ms | 92 % |
/// | `large` | 7.59 M | ~882 ms | 93 % |
///
/// `quarter` is the default: it is 17× faster than `large` for 5 points less denoising, and it
/// degrades far more gracefully when the camera's noise profile is off (`large` reads as *worse*
/// than `quarter` under a mis-scaled sigma, which is why sigma calibration must be right before
